Dictionaries may look very similar to a “List”. Still, dictionaries have some distinct features that do not hold true for other data types like lists, and those features make it (python dictionary) special."

    "- It is unordered (no sequence is required - data or entries have no order)<br>\n",
    "- It is mutable (values can be changed even after its formation, or new data/information can be added to the already existing dictionary, we can also pop/remove an entry completely)<br>\n",
    "- It is indexed (Dictionary contains key-value pairs, and indexing is done with keys. Also, after the Python 3.7th update, the compiler stores the entries in the order they are created)<br>\n",
    "- No duplication of data (each key is unique; no two keys can have the same name, so there is no chance for a data being overridden)\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "If we talk a little about how it works, its syntax comprises of key and values separated by colons in curly brackets, where the key is used as a keyword, as we see in real life dictionaries, and the values are like the explanation of the key or what the key holds (the value). And for the successful retrieval of the data, we must know the key so that we can access its value, just like in a regular oxford dictionary where if we don't know the word or its spelling, we cannot obtain its definition. Let's look into the syntax of a Python dictionary:"

I mean that Python provides us with a long list of already defined methods for dictionaries that can help us do our work in a shorter span of time with a minimal amount of code. Some of these methods are, clear(), copy(), popitem(), etc. The best part about them is that no extra effort is required to be put in order to learn the functionality as their names explain their functions (in most of the cases), such as clear() will clear all the data from the dictionary, making it empty, copy() will make a copy of the dictionary, etc."
